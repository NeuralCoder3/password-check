      You can try to hack the password.
      This is not the intended exercise but an exercise nonetheless.

      More information about the password check algorithm:
      We hard-coded the hash of the password.
      The hashing algorithm is PBKDF2 with SHA-512 and salt.
      The iterations are tuned to take a few seconds on a modern computer.
      This should make it hard to brute-force the password.
